            <p>
                Children need stimulation and quality education in early years
                to develop cognitive abilities. Depriving children of this can
                impair skills like memory, problem-solving, decision making
                which are critical for academic and life success. These effects
                may persist for lifetime.

            <h2 id="topic2">Social & Emotional Issues</h2>
            <p>
                Development of social skills allows children to form
                relationships, communicate and collaborate effectively.
                Inadequate education leaves children unable to regulate their
                emotions, behavior or understand social norms. This leads to
                anti-social tendencies and inability to integrate in society.

            <h2 id="topic3">Behavioral Problems</h2>
            <p>
                Children who lack proper education outlets may exhibit their
                distress through challenging physical and verbal behaviors.
                These include tantrums, fighting with peers, disobedience and
                abuse. Such problematic behaviors become barriers to leading a
                normal student life.

            <h2 id="topic4">Physical Health Effects</h2>
            <p>
                Educational deprivation limits opportunities for play,
                interaction and stimulation - critical for physical development
                and health. It may manifest as growth retardation, decreased
                immunity or chronic issues like vitamin deficiencies affecting
                child's physiological thriving.
